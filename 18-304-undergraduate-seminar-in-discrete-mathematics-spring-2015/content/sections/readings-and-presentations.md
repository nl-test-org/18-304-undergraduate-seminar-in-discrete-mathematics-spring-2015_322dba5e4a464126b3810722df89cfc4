Class readings included both a textbook and approved papers from recent mathematical literature. In each class, two students were each assigned / asked to give a 35-minute presentation based on a chapter in the textbook or on one of the papers. With 16 students in the class, each student gave three presentations throughout the term.

The textbook chapter titles are listed below, since most of the student presentations were based upon the text:

Aigner, Martin, Günter M. Ziegler, and Karl Heinrich Hofmann. _Proofs from THE BOOK_. Springer, 2014. ISBN: 9783662442043. \[Preview with [Google books](http://books.google.com/books?id=2iI9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover)\]
